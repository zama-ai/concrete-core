# How to create a new engine

In order to integrate a new operation into `concrete-core`, you have to follow the steps below:

1. [Add the engine and entities to the specification](#add-the-engine-and-entities-to-the-specification)
2. [Implement the engine and entities in a backend](#implement-the-engine-and-entities-in-a-backend)

## Add the engine and entities to the specification

Add the traits with trait bounds
Generic checks
Formal definition

## Implement the engine and entities in a backend

Public API for u32 and u64 integers
Private implementation with genericity
