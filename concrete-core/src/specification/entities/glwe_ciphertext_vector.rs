/// A trait implemented by types embodying a GLWE ciphertext vector.
///
/// A GLWE ciphertext vector is associated with a
/// [`KeyDistribution`](`GlweCiphertextVectorEntity::KeyDistribution`) type, which conveys the
/// distribution of the secret key it was encrypted with.
///
/// **Remark:** GLWE ciphertexts generalize LWE ciphertexts by definition, however in this library,
/// GLWE ciphertext entities do not generalize LWE ciphertexts, i.e., polynomial size cannot be 1.
